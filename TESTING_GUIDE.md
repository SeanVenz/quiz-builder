# Testing Guide: Quiz Builder Plugin Features

## Overview
This guide covers testing for both the "Show detailed results" feature fix and the new "Allow PDF Export" functionality.

## Features Covered
1. **Show detailed results** - Fixed setting functionality 
2. **Allow PDF Export** - New feature for downloading quiz results as PDF

## What Was Fixed/Added

### Show Detailed Results Fix
- **Issue**: The "Show detailed results" setting in the admin interface existed but didn't function properly
- **Root Cause**: The `qb_display_quiz_results()` function always used the basic results template instead of checking the setting
- **Solution**: Modified the function to conditionally use the `QB_Quiz_Results_Display` class when detailed results are enabled

### PDF Export Feature (NEW)
- **Feature**: New "Allow PDF Export" setting that conditionally shows a PDF download button on results pages
- **Implementation**: 
  - Database schema updated to include `allow_pdf_export` column

  - PDF generation using HTML templates with fallback support
  - Secure AJAX handler with nonce verification

## Key Components

### QB_Quiz_Results_Display Class
- Located in: `includes/results/class-quiz-results-display.php`
- Handles detailed results rendering
- Fetches user answers and compares with correct answers
- Generates HTML table with styling

### QB_Quiz_Settings_DB Class
- Located in: `includes/db/class-quiz-settings-db.php`
- Manages quiz settings storage and retrieval
- Handles the `show_user_answers` setting

### Basic Results Template
- Located in: `templates/quiz-results-html.php`
- Simple score display with retake button
- Used when detailed results are disabled

## Expected Behavior Differences

### Before Fix
- Setting existed in admin but had no effect
- Always showed basic results regardless of setting
- User answers were never displayed

### After Fix
- Setting controls result display type
- Basic results: Score + percentage + retake button
- Detailed results: Score + answers table + retake button
- Proper fallback if detailed results class fails

## Troubleshooting

### If Detailed Results Don't Show
1. Check that the quiz has the `show_user_answers` setting enabled in the database
2. Verify the attempt exists with valid answer data
3. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
4. Review WordPress error logs for PHP errors

### Database Verification
Run this SQL to check settings:
```sql
SELECT * FROM wp_qb_quiz_settings WHERE quiz_id = [YOUR_QUIZ_ID];
```
The `show_user_answers` column should be `1` for enabled.

### CSS Styling
The detailed results use CSS classes from `assets/css/quiz-results.css`:
- `.quiz-results` - Container
- `.quiz-answers-table` - Table styling
- `.correct-answer` - Green styling for correct answers
- `.incorrect-answer` - Red styling for wrong answers

## Success Criteria
âœ… Settings interface works and saves properly  
âœ… Basic results show when setting is disabled  
âœ… Detailed results show when setting is enabled  
âœ… Detailed results include user answers vs correct answers  
âœ… Visual indicators show correct/incorrect answers  
âœ… Setting changes are reflected immediately  
âœ… No errors in browser console or WordPress logs  

## Notes
- The fix maintains backward compatibility
- Existing quiz results continue to work
- No database changes were required
- The detailed results class was already implemented but unused
